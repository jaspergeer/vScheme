-- (* A basic representation of assembly code: 
--     it's essentially object code, but with labels. *)

-- (* You'll need to understand what's going on here, and how it's used *)

-- structure AssemblyCode = struct
--   (* A valid object-code instruction is also a valid assembly-code instruction.
--      Instruction forms with labels appear only in assembly code. *)
